## The Job Can Wait  
v2.1.1

Serious industries present to you: You will not get tasks that would require you to venture North before disabling Miracle Machine and Brain Scorcher.

## Exceptions
You play as any of the following faction:
- Monolith
- UNISG
- SIN
- Zombified

You have "Story mode" ticked off.

## Tasks included
All vanilla anomaly tasks are accounted for (in theory)
- Bounty
  - Capture Enemy Documents
- Spy extraction
- Assault
- Delivery
- Guide
- Fate/Lost Signal
- Anomaly measurement?!

iTheon's tasks:
- Stolen specimen
- Shakedown
- Blood Stained Coin
- No Step Back (This task is only available in Limansk, but now it won't even show up in PDA tasks before BS)

## Installation
Just chuck it at max prio.

## Compatibility
Manual patching needed
- New levels 0.53 (2023.07.25): Patch can be found in `gamedata\compatibility_patches\New_Levels_0.53`. There is a `README.txt` with instructions on how to apply (You just need to drag and drop 1 file no biggie).
- If you've disabled `G.A.M.M.A. Psy Fields in the North`. There is a folder in `gamedata\compatibility_patches` called `You disabled - G.A.M.M.A. Psy Fields in the North`. Check readme and install.
